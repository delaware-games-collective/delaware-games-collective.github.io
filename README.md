# Welcome to the Delaware Games Collective website!

We're just starting out, but feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jXYjVZQ), [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/DelawareGamesCollective/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DelawareGames) or contact an [organizer](mailto:alina.christenbury@gmail.com)!

The core idea is to build a community of game developers in the Delaware area.

It would be really amazing if we could become something of a hub for people interested in game development in this geographical area, and really become a place where people can meet each other and work on things together that are better with other people than they are alone!

I think long term we could host game jams and other outreach sort of events, and facilitate collaboration between people with different skillsets to work on games, maybe even to the point where people start companies out of it.
